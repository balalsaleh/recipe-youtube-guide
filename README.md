# recipe-youtube-guide
A group project where we will be creating a website which allows us to search for recipes and once we select a recipe we will be given video suggestions from Youtube on how these recipes can be created 


## MVP 

- the absolute least the product should have:
- a header to show an explanantion of what the site is
- a footer created by team members etc
  - a search bar to search for recipes
  - the recipes show based on whats been searched (recipe api)
  - a submit button
- implementation of videos
- we click on a recipe -> a youtube video on a seperate link/tab (youtube api)
- storing what weve searched for
- ENSURE WE USE BOOTSTRAP
- DEPLOYED ON GITHUB PAGES
- BE INTERACTIVE
- BE RESPONSIVE
- HAVE A POLISHED UI
- NOT TO USE ALERTS, CONFIRMS OR PROMPTS - USE MODALS

## Impovements once MVP is achieved:
  
- we click on a recipe and then we are shown a youtube video within the same html
- a favourites section for recipes
- suggestions for searching for recipes based on what is typed... like "chi" ... "chicken pasta, chicken pie etc"
